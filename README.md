## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a small React application with:

- Component-based architecture (`Header`, `Footer`, `ProgressBar`)  
- Pages (`Home`, `About`)  
- State management using React hooks (`useState`)  
- SPA routing-ready structure for deployment  

The main feature is a **progress bar** on the Home page that fills by 25% on each signal.

Implementation Details
State Management: useState is used for the progress bar

Progress Bar Logic: Clicking the button in Home.js increases progress by 25%, max 100%

SPA Readiness: Directory structure supports deployment to Netlify or Vercel

Optional Libraries
This project does not use additional libraries beyond React.

Decision: Keep dependencies minimal for clarity and faster build times.

Deployment
Deploy to Netlify or Vercel:

Connect your GitHub repository

Set build command: npm run build

Set publish directory: build/

Configure SPA fallback: redirect all 404s to /index.html
